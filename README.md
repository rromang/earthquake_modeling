# Machine Learning Regressions for the Prediction of Earthquake Characteristics/Features

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!

### Note: Part of the inspiration/ideas for some of the modeling machine learning code came from: https://www.kaggle.com/chenzecharya/earthquake-random-forest.

## Part One: Creation of Databases and Deployment of Earthquake API
### Objectives:
- Obtain the information from: https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes
- Place the information collected as part of a database to be accessed for training the model(s).
- Create and deploy an API with the information.
- Maintain the database and the API by updating and adding the new earthquake information monthly.

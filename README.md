### Note: Part of the inspiration/ideas for some of the modeling machine learning code came from: https://www.kaggle.com/chenzecharya/earthquake-random-forest.

## Creating the code for machine learning with data extracted from USGS and loaded to database.
### Objectives:
- Practice the best machine learning models that will work with the data use.
    - understand how things like NaN or the data type could affect a modeling approach.
- Load data from the created database and run models with it to practice connecting directly to a SQL database.

### Initial work/background:
- Choosing a ML algorithm for Earthquake Modeling:
    - **Problem**: Use obtained metrics from earthquake monitoring/measurement data from USGS to determine which of the metrics have better predictive capabilities.
    - **Goal**: Predictive. Models to be used should be supervised learning or semi-supervised.
    - **Data** (variables of interest) is numeric: Regression type of models are required for supervised learning models.
        - Data obtained from USGS can be used for training model and predict outcomes.
